### Research Theme
We envision addressing key challenges at the intersection of materials, energy, and sustainability. Our research goal is to leverage the advanced characterization tools to understand fundamental materials behavior at the multi length scales and engineer novel materials with improved properties for real-world applications in nanoscience and nanotechnology, ceramic engineering, and clean energy technologies. 
- Characterization: in situ, cryogenic, analytical, multi-modal, multi-dimensional
- Crystallography, Diffraction and Scattering
- Clean energy: batteries, catalysts, fuel cells
- Nanostructured materials: multifunctional multicomponent alloys and ceramics
