<b>Research Theme</b><br>
We envision addressing key challenges at the intersection of materials, energy, and sustainability. Our research goal is to leverage the advanced characterization tools to understand fundamental materials behavior at the multi-ength scales and engineer novel materials with improved properties for real-world applications in nanoscience and nanotechnology, ceramic engineering, and clean energy technologies.<br>
&bull;&nbsp;Characterization: in situ, operando, multi-modal, multi-dimensional<br>
&bull;&nbsp;Crystallography: diffraction and scattering<br>
&bull;&nbsp;Clean energy: batteries, catalysts, fuel cells<br>
&bull;&nbsp;Nanomaterials: multifunctional multicomponent alloys and ceramics<br>
