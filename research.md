	We envision addressing key challenges at the intersection of materials, energy, and sustainability. Our research goal is to leverage the advanced characterization tools to understand fundamental materials behavior at the multi-ength scales and engineer novel materials with improved properties for real-world applications in nanoscience and nanotechnology, ceramic engineering, and clean energy technologies.<br>
	<li>Characterization: in situ, operando, multi-modal, multi-dimensional</li>
	<li>Crystallography: diffraction and scattering</li>
	<li>Clean energy: batteries, catalysts, fuel cells</li>
	<li>Nanomaterials: multifunctional multicomponent alloys and ceramics</li>
