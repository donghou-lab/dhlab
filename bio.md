### Professional preparation
- I obtained my B.Eng. in Material Chemistry from Central South University, China in 2013.
- I worked in [Dr. Wenlong Cheng's lab](https://users.monash.edu.au/~wenlongc/) at Monash University, Australia from Dec. 2012 to May. 2013 as a visiting undergraduate student.
- I obtained my Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from North Carolina State University in 2017, under the supervision of [Dr. Jacob Jones](https://www.mse.ncsu.edu/people/jljone21/).
- After graduation, I had a short stay in the Scandinavia region, working as a postdoctoral fellow at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) under the supervision of [Dr. Mari-Ann Einarsrud](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/mari-ann.einarsrud).
- I did my postdoctoral training at Virginia Tech under the guidance of [Dr. Feng Lin](https://thelinlabatvt.weebly.com/pi.html) during 2019-2022.

- In 2024, I went back to the Carolinas and joined Clemson University.
- I collaborate with several DOE national laboratories, domestic and international institutions, and companies. The research has been supported by multiple federal agencies (NSF, DOE, and NASA).

### Some quotes I collected:
>- Make mistakes, quickly.
>- A week is 2% of the year. Time flies.
>- To achieve great things, you need a plan and not quite enough time.
>- Enthusiasm and motivation matter.

### Fun facts about me:
- In my spare time, I enjoy music, reading, hiking, and traveling, to explore and appreciate the beauty of life.
- I love football (a.k.a. "soccer" in the United States) and have been a fan of Real Madrid CF since ten.
- I sometimes email after-hours, to note the *ad hoc* thoughts or ideas. I don't anticipate the same from others.
- I worship low-context culture in my lab.
