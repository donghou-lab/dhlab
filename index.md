# <i class="fa fa-feather-alt fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;About Me

I received my Ph.D. from North Carolina State University in 2017, and my Bachelor degree from Central South University in 2013. I visited Monash University From Dec. 2012 to May. 2013.

My research interests include energy science, advanced characterization, and ceramics manufacturing.

# <i class="fa fa-layer-group fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Research Lab

For ***DHLab***, the research goal is to understand and control materials properties for electrochemical energy applications, as well as to contribute to the fundamental progress of materials electrochemistry and solid-state physics. The research projects cover the design and synthesis, processing, characterization, and applications of energy materials (e.g., batteries, catalysis, ferroelectrics, and capacitors).
