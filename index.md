# <i class="fa fa-feather-alt fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;About Me
- I received my Ph.D. from North Carolina State University, and my Bachelor degree from Central South University in China. The majority of my postdoctoral training was at Virginia Tech.
- I also visited/worked at Monash University in Australia, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), and University of Louisiana at Lafayette before joining Clemson. [More about me](/bio/index.html)<br>
- My personal research interests include energy science, crystallography, microscopy, electrochemistry, manufacturing, and data science.<br>
- I love teaching. [Courses and Outreach](/teaching/index.html)<br>

# <i class="fa fa-layer-group fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Research Lab
For ***DHLab***, the research goal is to understand and control materials properties for electrochemical energy applications, as well as to contribute to the fundamental progress of materials electrochemistry and solid-state physics. The research projects cover the design and synthesis, processing, characterization, and applications of energy materials (e.g., batteries, catalysis, ferroelectrics, and capacitors).<br>
